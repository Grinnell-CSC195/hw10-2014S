SQL notes

Things to build a website that shows data
-RDBMS database (relational database management System)
-server-side scripting like PHP
-use sql
-use html/css

data stored in tables
-rows x columns 

sql not case sensitive

select distinct only returns different 
use 'where' to filter, and/or to combine tests
order by to change the view
insert into to add things
update to change existing: MUST use where

SQL injection used by malicious users to get more things than are supposed to be

SQL parameters to avoid

Like to use patterns to filter

Primary key-- must be not null and unique. used to identify unique identity
