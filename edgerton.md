I disagree with some of the previous responders. I dont think SQL is pretty
cool. I wouldn't say it is cool at all. It is necessary. Although I lack
the knowledge of how to create an accessible database (using that RDBMS) or
much of a reason to do so, the appreciate the importance of accessing
databases when it comes to bigtime websites.
