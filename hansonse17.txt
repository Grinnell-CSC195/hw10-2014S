Thoughts on SQL bounced from the Internet off the mind of Seth Hanson.

SQL is a language designed to be used in operations involving
databases. It has several main functions:
          
    SELECT - extracts data from a database
    UPDATE - updates data in a database
    DELETE - deletes data from a database
    INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
    CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
    ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
    CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
    ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
    DROP TABLE - deletes a table
    CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
    DROP INDEX - deletes an index

Fun facts from Wikipedia:
    -Developed by IBM in the early '70s (a.k.a. 'pretty old')
    -Used to be called SEQUAL but had trademark issues with airplanes,
    became SQL (is more hip now)


It seems like this is a fairly complicated tool in web development -
perhaps the reason we are not trying it ourselves - but it clearly is
highly useful. Oh, if I had a database I was interested in, SQL would be my
first choice, hands down.
