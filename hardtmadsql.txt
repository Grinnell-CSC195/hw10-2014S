. Basic commands:
	- select colname from tablename where condition;
	- order by colname asc/desc;
	- group by colname1, arthop(colname2), from tablename, group by colname;
	- insert into tablename (colname1, colname2, ... , colnamen) values (val1, val2, ... , valn);
	- delete from tablename where condition;

. SQL processes data in groups. 
. Can select distinct data versus (default) all.
. LIKE % and _ make conditional statements much more powerful.
. Joins lets us store and select groups of related data in different tables.
