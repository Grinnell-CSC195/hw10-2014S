SQL seems very interesting and thinking about database management makes me think of websites/businesses like Amazon and Ebay differently.


I watched a video titled "Understanding the core components of SQL Server"
It can be found using the following link: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXbm0qGwgAw

Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)
- Examples include: SQL Server, SQLite, Oracle, FoxPro, etc.

When working with a lot of data, RDBMS can check against adding invalid
data, and also when multiple people try to access/edit data at once

controls what gets access to the data
if you want to get to the data, you go through the DBMS
data is the business for many RDBMS clients (Ebay, Amazon, etc.)
more than just a place to dump your data b/c it gives:
   security 
   integrity
   performance
   reliability

good database also needs to be able to survive hardware issues w/o corrupting data 

After 4 minutes, I realized that it wasn't actually going to be a tutorial,
so I switched videos

I watched a tutorial titled "SQL Server Queries Part 1 - Writing Basic
Queries." It can be found at the following link:

(When I'm learning a new language, the first thing I learn how to do is make comments)

I learned a couple other new things, before switching over to w3schools
-"In MySQL there are three main types : text, number, and Date/Time types."
-"SQL developers have to decide what types of data will be stored inside each and every table column when creating a SQL table. The data type is a label and a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will interact with the stored data."
