SQL can be termed as a powerful tool that makes the exchange of data between a relational database and a server possible. Having used databases on parse.com before, I can say the language used to interact with those databases is pretty similar to SQL. For instance, parse queries are nearly identical to SQL statements (spare for syntax). I think one of SQL’s strongest aspects is its simplicity - statements are simple and direct. However, a lack of uniformity seems to be an issue, since there are tons of different versions out there. Maybe it’s time for another Grinnellian to spearhead a movement to unite all SQL iterations under one banner? I also read up on MonogoDB, which seems to be gaining in popularity as the preferred RDBMS, and that seemed interesting since it relies more on JSON-like objects to store data.
