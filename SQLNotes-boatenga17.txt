SQL stands for Structured Query Language and it is used to interact with a database. It is usually the standard
language used for relational database management systems. SQL is used to perform tasks such as store, update and query
databases.Most of the actions done in SQL are done with statements. It is useful to note that
SQL is not case sensitive and that most SQL databases have their own proprietary extensions in addition
to the SQL standard. There are some basic commands used for this language:


SELECT
List the columns including expressions involving columns from base tables or views to be projected 
into the table that will be the result of the command.

FROM	
Identifies the tables or views from which columns will be chosen to appear in the result table.
This must also list the tables or views needed to join tables to process the query.

WHERE	
Includes conditions that restrict the rows selected as well as the conditions for joining two or more tables or views.

I personally think the learning curve for SQL is quite manageable and it's pretty easy to understand. It also allows
users to create and customize dynamic databases which could be used to interact with various platforms like websites and
mobile applications.
