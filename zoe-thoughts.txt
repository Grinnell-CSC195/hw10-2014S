SQL!! 

I think SQL is pretty cool. I really like tables, and this is the easiest
language I've seen that deals with tables (especially compared to using HTML
and javascript...) 

According to the W3schools tutorial, 
"To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

    An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
    To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
    To use SQL to get the data you want
    To use HTML / CSS"

This is all understandable... However, I wish there was an easier way to
use SQL to build simple tables on webpages than having to use server-side
scripting and a database program. Basically I just want to build pretty
tables all the time.
